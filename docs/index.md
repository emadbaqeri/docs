We are an alternative to big tech personal cloud storage by focusing on a simple premise : you should own your own data.

We plan to do that by providing a plug and play BOX based on open source hardware that you can customize to your own personal requirements.

Because the hardware is open source, you can also choose to [DIY](./diy_setup.md) your own hardware setup and still utilize the BOX platform.

The BOX all of the necessary software for you to enjoy your home photos/video from the comfort of your living room.

We will also utilize the decentralized web to provide you with additional services that you can optionally consume.  This decentralized web will provide a free and open market for service providers.

The BOX will also have an open [API](./api.md) that third party developers can leverage to build rich user experiences on top of your data.
