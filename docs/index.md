# Welcome To Functionland

We are building an alternative to big tech personal cloud storage by focusing on a simple premise: <b>you should own your own data</b>.

More specifically, the data we are currently focused on liberating are people's home photos and video.

We plan to do that by providing a plug and play BOX based on open source hardware and open protocols that you can customize to suit your own personal requirements.

We will also utilize the decentralized web to provide you with additional services.  You can optionally enable these services to obtain additional functionality not possible solely with an individual BOX such as (but not limited to) :

  * geographic replication

  * load balancing

  * highly available content distribution

This decentralized web will enable a free and open market for service providers.  This means you can become not just a consumer but also a producer in this new ecosystem we call the FULA network.

We will provide an open [API](./api.md) specification that you can leverage to build rich user experiences for BOX customers.

Like what you hear?  Become a pioneer and join us on our journey in bringing Web3 to the mainstream today!

You can do that by :

  * heading over to [getting started](./getting-started) and learning all about developing your own DApps on top of the BOX platform

  * [subscribing](https://fx.land) for updates to get notified when we launch on Kickstarter

  * providing feedback/input on our [RFCs](https://github.com/functionland/docs/tree/main/RFCs)

  * join us on one of our [socials](https://linktr.ee/fxland)
