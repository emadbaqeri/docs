# Welcome To Functionland

We are an alternative to big tech personal cloud storage by focusing on a simple premise: <b>you should own your own data</b>.

We plan to do that by providing a plug and play BOX based on open source hardware that you can customize to suit your own personal requirements.

Because the hardware is open source, you can also choose to [DIY](./diy_setup.md) your own hardware setup and still utilize the BOX platform.

The BOX includes all of the necessary software for you to enjoy your home photos/video from the comfort of your living room.

We will also utilize the decentralized web to provide you with additional services.  You can optionally enable these services to obtain additional functionality not possible solely with an individual BOX such as (but not limited to) :

  * geographic replication

  * load balancing

  * highly available content distribution

This decentralized web will enable a free and open market for service providers.  This means you can become not just a consumer but also a producer in this new ecosystem we call the FULA network.

The BOX will also have an open [API](./api.md) that third party developers can leverage to build rich user experiences on top of your data.

Like what you hear?  Become a pioneer and join us on our journey in bringing Web3 to the mainstream today!  

You can do that by :

  * [subscribing](https://fx.land) for updates to get notified when we launch on Kickstarter

  * providing feedback/input on our [RFCs](https://github.com/functionland/docs/tree/main/RFCs)

  * join us on one of our [socials](https://linktr.ee/fxland)
