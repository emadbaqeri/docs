# BOX API

The BOX API was designed by us for us with the intention that you (a third party open source developer) will be able to leverage in order to build other compelling/rich user experiences for BOX customers.

It comprises of the following.

## [Graph](./api/graph.md)

A rich graphql based data API you can use to query for any file metadata based on various query parameters.

## [File](./api/file.md)

An interface for you to upload files (eg/ photos, videos or any type of document) and efficiently retreive them for use in your web/mobile Dapp.
