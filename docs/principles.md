# Functionland Principles

The following principles are intended to help guide us in making various decisions while on our journey to becoming an impactful "Web3" company.

It should be noted that it is impossible to achieve perfection in a lot of these principles.  Moreover, there may be tradeoffs or trilemmas to consider during the designing process.

In that sense, perhaps a better word for them are "ideals" we intend to follow.

## Equal Access to Technology

Every individual should have the same potential to gain the same capabilities as anyone else in any network we choose to participate in or create ourselves.

Networks we choose to participate in or create ourselves should aim to avoid ['tragedy of the commons'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons) by design.

## Decentralization

Equal access means the networks we choose to build or participate in should aim to avoid hierachy in the form of trees or hub and spoke mechanisms.

This could be applicable from both an economic and technical perspective.

## Data Ownership

Each person or small group should be sovereign over their own data.

The additional principles as outlined here should help illustrate what that actually means.

## Secure

It should not be possible for unauthorized:

  * access to people's private data

  * deletion of their data

## Private

People should have full control over how they share their data with others (either other persons or bots).

By default, upon creation, their data should be encrypted and the only person that holds the keys to unlock that data is the owner or anyone they give access to.

This means if Functionland (or another party) ever stores data on the owner's behalf it should be impossible for them to access it.

## Zero Lock-In

People will never have to worry about others holding their data hostage because it will not be possible for others to do so.

If a data owner decides to discontinue any service(s), they should still have access to their data.

They should also have some basic functionality for accessing their data and be able to easily batch export it to a simple format.

## Censorship Free

People should not be prevented by any intermediary from sharing information with others.

People should also have the freedom to choose what information they consume.

## Chain Agnostic

When evaluating networks to participate in or create on our own, Functionland should be cognizant of the fact that there will inevitably be some lock-in.

It may not always be possible, however, to the best of our ability we should always provide alternatives to using a certain network.

We should also hold each network we participate in to all other principles with the highest standard.

## Using Third-Party Services

When Functionland engages with other partners/ecosystems to provide additional services to Functionland customers they will ask :

  * what is the cost and what are the tradeoffs as outline above to the Functionland customer?

The answer to these questions should not compromise on the previously stated principles.
